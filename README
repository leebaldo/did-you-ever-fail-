1.	I already failed an exam during my grade school and high school life. Because whenever I have an exam all of my ideas are all disappearing. And most of the time I always cram, I will just study the time before the teacher give the exam or night before it. Sometimes most especially in History I am really having a hard time in understanding the lessons about our history because of too many dates, names, events, and everything to memorize.
2.	A midterm here in CSB is also the same to the exams in high school. But the only difference is it is much more relax in college because the subjects are not given all at the same time or its not bulk for us we are having a lot of time to study and prepare well in our exam. I should learn how to understand the teaching of my teacher, and to be able to take down notes. So that I could be able to pass my finals in my 1st term.
